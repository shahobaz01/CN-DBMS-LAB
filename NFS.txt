NFS:

1. First we'll have to check whether the directory is present or not:  ls -ld /nfs_share

2. Now create the directory if not present: mkdir /nfs_share

    i. Now Change the permission: chmod 777 /nfs_share
    ii. Check whether permission changed or not: ls -ld /nfs_share

3. Now we will configure it in configuration file: vim /etc/exports

4. Now inside the file we will write: 

    i. /nfs  192.168.1.0/24(rw,sync)  -> there should be no space here

5. Now enter these command after exiting from the configure file:

    i. exportfs -r
    ii. exportfs -a
    iii. systemctl restart rpcbind
    iv. systemctl restart nfs

Configuration part is done

6. To check the directory in your machine : showmount -e

7. To check directory of some other machine: showmount -e {ip_address of nfs server}

8. Now we have to mount the instance of some other device into our own machine: mount 192.168.1.{ip of that device like 43/42/41}:/nfs_share /mnt

9. To check if mount is done or not: df -HT

10. Create a file (txt file): vim aneesh.txt

11. Now move to mnt: cd /mnt


12. Now check the content of the file: cat aneesh.txt

13. Now opne the same file through vim to check permission: vim aneesh.txt

14. Now do: cd - and umount /mnt

15. To change the permission to read and write by opening the configure file again:

    i. vim /etc/exports
    ii. nfs_share 192.168.1.0/24(rw,sync,no_root_squash)

16. Then run those 4 commands again: mount 192.168.1.{friends ip like 45/44/42}:/nfs_share /mnt

17. Now move to mnt: cd /mnt

18. Now modify friend's file: vim swastik_nfs.txt
    and then save and exit

19. Move out from mnt directory: cd -

20. Now umount again: umount /mnt

21. Check if umounted or not: df -HT
